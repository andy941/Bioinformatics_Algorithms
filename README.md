C++ implementation of the exercises and examples from the book:
	*"Bioinformatics Algorithms - design and implementation in python"* by Miguel Rocha & Pedro G. Ferreira 

I wanted to know more about algorithms to sharpen my bioinformatics skills. 
It seemed fitting to do the walkthrough in C++ since I just finished a comprehensive introduction in the language.
	See the repository **Cpp_principles_exercises**.
